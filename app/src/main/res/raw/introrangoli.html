in which patterns are created on the floor in living rooms or courtyards using 
materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower petals. It is 
usually made during Diwali or Tihar (collectively known as Deepawali) , Onam, 
Pongal and other Indian, Bangladeshi and Nepalese festivals related to Hinduism. 
Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the art form 
and the tradition alive.<br />
<br />
The various names for this art form and similar practices include Kolam in Tamil 
Nadu, Mandana in Rajasthan, Chowkpurana in Chhattisgarh, Alpana in West Bengal, 
Aripana in Bihar, Chowk pujan in Uttar Pradesh, Muggu in Andhra Pradesh, Golam 
kolam or kalam in Kerala and others.<br />
<br />
The purpose of rangoli is decoration, and it is thought to bring good luck. 
Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore and 
practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by women. 
Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, 
auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and 
gatherings. In Nepal, Colorful rangoli are made from dyes and are lit up at 
night outside peoples homes and businesses.<br />
<br />
Rangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and 
petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very 
elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry 
or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which sindoor (vermilion), haldi 
(turmeric) and other natural colours can be added. Chemical colors are a modern 
variation. Other materials include colored sand, red brick powder and even 
flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangolis.</p>

different states of India; for example, Rangoli in Karnataka, Chaookpurna in 
Chhattisgarh, Mandana in Rajasthan, Aripan in Bihar, Alpana in Bengal, Sanskar 
Bharti in Maharashtra, Kolam in Tamil Nadu, Muggulu in Andhra Pradhesh, Aipan in 
Kumaon, Kalam in Kerala, and Saathiya in Gujarat. Not just in names, the designs 
also vary as per the region.<br />
<br />
In middle India mainly in Chhattisgarh Rangoli is called Chaook and is generally 
drawn at the entrance of a house or any other building. Dried rice flour or 
other forms of white dust powder is used for drawing Chaooks. Although there are 
numerous traditional Chaook patterns, many more can be created depending on the 
creativity of the person who draws it.<br /><br /> It is considered auspicious as it
signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. 
It is not drawn like a picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. 
Generally women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the 
entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw 
the Chaook. In Maharashtra, rangolis are drawn on the doors of homes so that 
evil forces attempting to enter are repelled.<br /><br /> During the festival of Onam in
Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the 
design growing larger and more complex every day. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradhesh 
and Karnataka, the Kolam is drawn upon the ground or floor daily. The designs 
are geometric and symmetrical shapes but the materials used are similar rangoli: 
rice flour or slurry is used. In Rajasthan the Mandana are painted on walls. 
Mmandne, various festivals, major festivals and can be categorized based on 
seasons. Different shapes depending on the size of it also can be shared. 
Kumaon's "writing beat 'or in a variety of plotting symbols Thapa, artistic 
designs, Bellbutoan is used. Alikhthap of society apart - separated by different 
groups - different icons and art media is used.<br /><br />
Rangoli's most important element is Utswdhermita. These are auspicious symbols 
that have a central role in the design. The design for generations are passed on 
as they are made - and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each 
new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some 
major symbols used in Rangoli are the lotus flower, its leaves, mango, Tue vase, 
fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, peacocks, and human figures 
and foliage. Oftentimes Rangoli are made on special occasions like Diwali. Some 
special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, 
Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India.<br />
<br />
The second key element is using the materials used to make the rangoli. The 
materials used are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in 
all homes, rich or poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are 
- Pise rice solution, dried powder made from the leaves color, charcoal, burned 
soil was, wood sawdust, etc..<br />
<br />
The third important element is the background. Rangoli use the background of a 
clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the 
middle, corners, or as a bell is created around. Dehri gateway is a tradition of 
making rangoli. God's seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on 
the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli. With time, imagination and 
innovative ideas in Rangoli art is also incorporated. Hospitality and tourism 
has also had its effect and rangoli has been commercially developed in places 
such as hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance still remain.<br />
<br />
Rangoli is also created using coloured rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric 
(haldi), Vermillion (Sindoor) and coloured sand.<br />
There are two primary ways to make a Rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the 
materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with 
colour. Using a white material like chalk, sand, paint or flour, the artist 
marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a 
square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying 
that initially-simple pattern creates what is often and intricate and beautiful 
design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and geometric patterns are 
common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a 
peacock, icon or landscape). "Readymade Rangoli" patterns, often as stencils or 
stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise 
designs.<br />
<br />
Once the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with 
colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured 
rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or dry pigments. The artist might also 
choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals 
to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like crayons, dyes or dyed fabrics, 
acrylic paints and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, 
allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial 
method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise 
method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.<br />
<br />
Shape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square 
grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; Onam 
Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based 
on gypsum (chirodi), in the South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are 
typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people 
within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and 
mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like 
sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs and exotic materials.<br /><br />
In Tamil Nadu there is a prevalent myth, that Andaal worshipped Lord Thirumaal 
and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. So during this month, unmarried 
girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the god Thirumal. 
Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. See also 
references to Rangoli in legend, such as in the - Ramayana at Sita's wedding 
pavilion where the discussion refers to rangoli there. Cultural development of 
Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers. There are modern 
and traditional rangoli designs. The designs are usually inspired by nature, but 
they can also be in the form of abstract art.</p>
